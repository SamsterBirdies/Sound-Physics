# Sound-Physics
A Minecraft mod that provides realistic sound attenuation, reverberation, and absorption through blocks.

This is a fork of djpadbit, which is a fork of daipenger, which is a fork of sonic ether.

I'm a noob, and im kinda just trying to use this (and other repos) to learn minecraft modding. Please dont hurt me.

There is no release build for this fork yet, and you probably dont want one.
